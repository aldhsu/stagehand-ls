# What is Stagehand
Stagehand is a generalised alternate file finder and file generator.
It aims to be useful for projects that have a lot of file conventions.
eg. Rails projects - from a model file you can infer where the test for the model file in question should be.

# How does it work?
[ ] Uses .projections.json format from https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist
[ ] Uses LSP code action for maximum compatibility

# Stretch goals
[ ] Uses treesitter for smarter templating
[ ] Embeddable logic in templates

# TODO
[x] Initialize an LSP
[x] Have the code action capability
[x] Report back code action capability
[ ] Go to alternate file action
